# Building

Currently only Visual Studio is supported. There no plans to support any other compiler.

## Visual Studio

You can try and see if there is a project/SLN file in the **build** directory for your version. If not, you can try and migrate one, or make one from scratch.

### Project from Scratch

Settings may differ slightly depending on your version of Visual Studio. The version used here was Visual Studio 2008.

**Step 1** - Creating a Project

- Create a new empty Visual Studio Solution Project File. I recommend putting this in the BUILD directory. 
- When asked what kind of project you want, select **Empty Win32 Application**.
- Delete all the default folders/filters it comes with (Source Files, Header Files, and Resource Files)

**Step 2** - Adding Source Files

- Add existing files. I recommend making a filter for each of the folders you will be adding.
- To add the source files, you can do this by going to the menu bar, Project > Add Existing Item. Then navigate to the **SRC** directory. Select all the files (CTRL-A) and press add.

**Step 3** - Project Properties
First go to Project > Properties. Change configuration to All Configurations.

- Under Debugging, change:
  - Working Directory to `$(TargetDir)`
- Under C/C++ > General, change:
  - Warning Level to `Level 4 (/W4)`
- Under Linker > Input, change:
  - Additional Dependencies to `comctl32.lib`
- Manifest Tool > Input and Output, change:
  - Additional Manifest Files to `$(InputDir)..\..\..\src\resources\application.manifest`
    - Note that `$(InputDir)` might be $(SolutionDir) depending on your version.
    - Note that for Visual Studio 2022 that the manifest file is `application_2022.manifest`
- Build Events > Pre-Build Event
  - Add the following line to Command Line: `$(SolutionDir)..\\..\\gitinfo.bat`
- Build Events > Post-Build Event
  - Add these two lines to Command Line:
    - `XCOPY "$(SolutionDir)..\\..\\src\\assets\\tileset.bmp" "$(TargetDir)" /Y /D`
    - `XCOPY "$(SolutionDir)..\\..\\src\\assets\\lang_en.txt" "$(TargetDir)" /Y /D`



Next, Change configuration to Release.

- Under C/C++ > Optimization, Change:
  - Optimization to `Full Optimization (/Ox)`



The project should be ready to build after that.
